## Synopsis
This is method to infer sentiment from publically available sources of comments

## Code Example

Later

Show what the library does as concisely as possible,
developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example.
Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation
This project was created as part of Startup Iowa
It is inended to be a learning experience in all aspects of getting a business off the ground.
As time permits I will document the process because in the heat of design the 
documentation tends to be the last item of significance when a real running app is what is needed.

## Installation

This was templated and I will document how that is achieved

## API Reference

Various API's were used like twitter facebook google and others
This is extrensive

## Tests

Currently there are Python tests, however I will add tests to understand some of the code limitations and corner cases

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
PAUL
Paul is making a contribution finally
It does need to be documented and I hope to make this more of a learning tool by adding the wiki and other information
about how the node.js app works from a hardware and network perspective

## License
Ther is a License and I will review which best suits this after conferring witrh the main contributors
